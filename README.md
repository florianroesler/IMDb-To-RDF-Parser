IMDb-To-RDF-Parser
==================

#What does it do?
'IMDb-To-RDF-Parser' transforms the available IMDb dump to valid RDF triples. Right now it supports the majority of important dump files that like actors, producers, movie titles and more. With the latest data base patch, more than 72 million triples could be created.

#Supported Platforms

At the current stage, Windows is not supported as the application makes heavy use of the command line, where most of the commands aren't available on Windows.
